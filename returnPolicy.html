            <h3>Returns</h3>

            <p>We offer a 30 calendar-day return period for your new cat. During this time, you may return the cat to us for a refund or exchange if you find that it is not suitable for your household.</p>

            <h3>Refunds</h3>

            <p>Once we receive the returned cat and verify its condition, we will proceed with processing your refund. Refunds will be issued to your original method of payment. Please allow some time for the refund to be processed and for the credit to reflect in your account, as processing times may vary depending on your financial institution.</p>

            <h3>Exchanges</h3>
