                <p>At Kittens, we are committed to the health and well-being of our cats and ensuring that they go to loving and responsible homes. We stand behind the health of our cats and offer the following health guarantee to our customers:</p>
                
                <h3>Health Screening</h3>
                
                <p>All our cats undergo thorough health screenings by licensed veterinarians before being made available for adoption. These screenings include but are not limited to examinations for common health issues, vaccinations, and testing for contagious diseases.</p>
                
                <h3>Health Guarantee Period</h3>
                
                <p>We offer a health guarantee period of [number of days] days from the date of purchase. During this time, we guarantee that your cat is free from any undisclosed health issues that may affect its quality of life or lifespan.</p>
                
                <h3>Health Certification</h3>
                
                <p>Upon purchase, you will receive a health certificate documenting the results of the cat's health screenings and vaccinations. This certificate serves as proof of the cat's health status at the time of purchase.</p>
                
                <h3>Health Issues Covered</h3>
                
                <p>Our health guarantee covers genetic health issues and congenital defects that significantly impact the cat's quality of life or require costly veterinary care. Common health issues covered may include but are not limited to heart conditions, kidney disease, and hereditary disorders.</p>
                
                <h3>Exclusions</h3>
                
                <p>Please note that our health guarantee does not cover health issues resulting from neglect, accidents, injuries, or improper care after the cat has been purchased. It is the responsibility of the owner to provide proper nutrition, veterinary care, and a safe environment for the cat.</p>
                
                <h3>Making a Claim</h3>
                
                <p>If your cat develops a health issue covered by our health guarantee within the guarantee period, please contact us immediately. We will work with you to resolve the issue, which may include providing veterinary care, offering a replacement cat (subject to availability), or issuing a refund.</p>
                
                <h3>Health Maintenance</h3>
                
                <p>To maintain the health and well-being of your cat, we recommend regular veterinary check-ups, vaccinations, and preventive care. Proper nutrition, exercise, and environmental enrichment are also essential for your cat's overall health and happiness.</p>
